The PS cartridge (Púlya so Stal'ným serdéchnikom - \"Bullet with a Steel core\") was introduced into service in 1949 for Soviet 7.62x39mm caliber weaponry, and over the years has undergone numerous changes in the materials used for its construction. Thanks to the tempered steel core that this model has, it is able to pierce through basic ballistic body protections as well as some intermediate models in addition to provide a significant stopping power effect, however, it has a high bounce probability off various surfaces.",

The AK-74 was equipped with a new buttstock, handguard (which retained the AKM-type finger swells), and gas cylinder. The stock has a shoulder pad different from that on the AKM, which is rubber and serrated for improved seating against the shooter. In addition, there are lightening cuts on each side of the buttstock. The buttstock, lower handguard, and upper heatguard were first manufactured from laminated wood, this later changed to a synthetic, plum or dark brown colored fiberglass.",

The bullet in this cartridge was designed to crumble and rapidly lose speed when hitting a solid object in order to reduce the probability of ricochets during urban operations at the cost of penetration capabilities, consequently, this endows it with an outstanding stopping power effect thanks to its caliber and capability to inflict critical adverse effects on the target after impact.",

The rifle ensures maximum comfort of the user while aiming and shooting, featuring a quick sighting line recovery, high reliability and ergonomics. The stainless steel barrel has a thread for installing a muzzle brake-compensator or a sound suppressor. The equipped muzzle brake-compensator effectively reduces impulse and allows the most comfortable recoil handling.",

It's a variant of the M1911, and has been the standard-issue side arm for the Force Recon Element of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Units since 1985. The improved M45A1 features several changes to the original M1911A1 design. One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, a picatinny rail, and a desert tan Cerakote finish.",
